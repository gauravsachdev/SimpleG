  ------- MODEL REPORT ------
  The un-condensed model contains:
      93 variables comprising 3860 thousand components
  and 67 equation blocks comprising 3027 thousand separate equations.
  
      10 variables (comprising 1513 thousand components) will be backsolved for.
      10 variables (comprising 1437 thousand components) were substituted out.
      0 variables (comprising 0 components) were omitted.
  
  So the condensed model contains:
      73 variables comprising 909 thousand components
  and 47 equation blocks comprising 76 thousand separate equations.
